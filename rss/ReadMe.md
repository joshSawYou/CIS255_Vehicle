Vehicle_UML_High-Level.png purpose:
  The purpose of the Vehicle_UML_High-Level.png file is High-Level UML Class Notation Image of the UML Design. This is Class Names ONLY. It further explains the ancestrial relationships between classes (parent, children, etc.) and if they are associated or inherited. Detailed discription of the overall UML is in the UML design description in the doc readme or the src readme.


Vehicle_UML_DodgeChallenger.png purpose:
  This is a unique model abstract class that inherites the public model class. Keep in mind that because it inherites the model class it gains all of the attributes, methods, and relationships from the model class (by this I mean: since this is a child class of model and model is a child of the make class which is a child of the vehicle class, it inherites all attributes and methods and all inheritances/associations from all of these classes)

Vehicle_UML_Model.png
  This Model class inherites the Make class and therefore gains all of plublic make class's and public vehicle class's attributes and methods and thier inheritances and associations. This model class has its own attributes and methods, as well. Its attributes are public modelName which is a string and protected year which is an int. It also has its own public "displayInfo()" method. 

Vehicle_UML_Make.png
  This Make class inherites the public Vehicle class and therefore gain all of vehicle's attributes, methods, and its associations. The Make class has its own attribute of protected MakeType which is an enum and association relationship. This makeType attribute is an enum which consists of the options: FORD, TOYOTA, DODGE, HONDA, and TESLA. It also has its own public "displayInfo()" method. 

Vehicle_UML_Type.png
  This Type class inherites the public Vehicle class and therefore gain all of vehicle's attributes, methods, and its associations. The Type class has its own attribute of protected vehicleType which is an enum and association relationship. This vehicleType attribute is an enum which consists of the options: Sedan, Coupe, and Truck. It also has its own public "displayInfo()" method. 

Vehicle_UML_Vehicle.png
  This Vehicle class has an association with protected EngineType. EngineType is an enum with options: Gasoline, Diesel, and Electric. Keep in mind that any child class of vehicle also inherites this association with engineType. The Vehicle class's other attributes protected color which is a string and protected doorCount which is an int. Vehicle class also has its own public "displayInfo()" method. 

Vehicle_UML_VehicleStorage.png
  This VehicleStorage class has an association with public Vechile. The vehicleStorage class has its own attribute of a private list called Vehicles. It also has its own public methods: addVehicle(), displayVehicles(), and saveToFile().
