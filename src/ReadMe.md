Source Code Explanation: 
We do not have source yet. But I would imagine it would pull from some sort of vehicle database.

Folder Structure(s):
Java SDK Version, 


IDE: I used JGrasp.

Class Diagram UML:
I did a class hierarchy. I based this on what I thought would be the class ancestory of this project. For example, I figured it would start with Vehicle as highest parent class. Its children would be Vehicle Makes. Vehicle makes children would be the Vehicle Type. Next comes the model. Models children are the years.
